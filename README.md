# MFC_Modeling
This is the Github repository for the code used in the paper Deep Learning for Predicting Microbial Fuel Cell Energy Output. All relevant datasets and models are stored at https://huggingface.co/datasets/adunlop621/Soil_MFC/tree/main

Type1.ipynb, Type2.ipynb, and SNN.ipynb contained the code used to train all all the models in the paper, as well as load pretrained models and run time series rolling validation.
