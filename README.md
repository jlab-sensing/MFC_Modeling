# MFC_Modeling
This project trains a random forest to predict the power output of an MFC based on the current environmental conditions (Temp, VWC, Soil EC).

The main code for the project is located in dataloader.ipynb, can be be opened in Google Colab and executed by running each cell in order from top to bottom.
